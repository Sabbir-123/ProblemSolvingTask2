# The Problem Solving Task Details
```
1. At first step, the function first formats the input string by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation using a regular expression, and removing any spacing. 
2. Then at second step, it creates a reversed version of the formatted string by splitting it into an array of characters, reversing the array, and joining the characters back together.
3. Finally, it compares the formatted string with its reversed version and returns true if they are equal (i.e., the string is a palindrome) or false otherwise.
